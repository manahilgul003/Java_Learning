#1.How Does JVM works
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that enables Java applications to run on any device or operating system with a JVM implementation. The JVM architecture consists of several key components: the ClassLoader, which loads class files; the Method Area, which stores class structures and method code; the Heap, where objects and arrays are stored and shared across threads; the Java Stacks, which hold local variables and partial results for each thread; the PC Registers, which track the current instruction for each thread; and the Native Method Stacks, which manage native code execution. The Execution Engine, including the interpreter and Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, executes bytecode by converting it to native machine code at runtime. The Native Method Interface facilitates interaction with native libraries. The process of compiling and executing Java code involves compiling high-level code into bytecode, loading class files into RAM, verifying bytecode security, and using the Execution Engine for final execution. Java is both a compiled and interpreted language because it compiles code into bytecode and interprets bytecode into machine code at runtime, contributing to its platform independence. Despite initial performance bottlenecks due to dynamic linking and run-time interpretation, recent Java versions have significantly improved execution efficiency through various optimizations.
#2.How Garbage Collector works in Java
Garbage Collection in Java is an automatic memory management process that reclaims memory from objects no longer in use, preventing memory leaks and crashes. When objects are no longer referenced, the Garbage Collector (GC) identifies and deletes them to free up memory. Unlike in C, where programmers manually manage memory with functions like free(), Java's garbage collection simplifies memory management by handling object deallocation automatically. This process ensures efficient memory use and contributes to the stability of Java programs.
#3.Java Stack and Heap: Java Memory Allocation
In Java, memory allocation is organized into several sections to manage different types of data efficiently. Stack Memory handles method calls, local variables, and reference variables in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner, while Heap Memory is used for storing objects and instance variables created with the new() method. The Code Section contains the compiled bytecode of the program, and the Static Section holds static data and methods shared across instances. This structured memory allocation ensures effective management of variables, objects, and methods throughout the lifecycle of a Java application.
#4.Static Variable in Java: What is Static Block & Method
In Java, static variables, static methods, and static blocks are class-level features shared among all instances of a class. A static variable is initialized once at the start of program execution and can be accessed directly through the class name. A static method belongs to the class rather than to any instance, can only access static data and methods, and cannot use this or super. A static block is a block of code that runs when the class is first loaded into the JVM, typically used for initializing static data members. These elements work together to manage class-level data and functionality without needing to instantiate objects.
